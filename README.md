# TLV_Frame_Emulator
This project will simulate a scenario in which the set and get commands are sent from a mobile (User input on terminal in our case) and get appropriate response from the device (response will be generated from the users system in our case) in BLE command frame (TLV) format. 

Users will need to manually enter the BLE command frame (TLV) on the terminal acting as a mobile device. Device response will be simulated by the users system only.

A TLV frame from the terminal will be sent to the system for set or get command then an appropriate response will be generated in the TLV structure itself in the users system and will be sent as a response to the user on the terminal.
